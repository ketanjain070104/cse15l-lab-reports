## Part 2
CSE 15L is arguably one of the best classes I have taken here at UC San Diego. I've had a fantastic experience wherein I gained a wealth of skills, while joking around with professor Joe. Although the class felt challenging initially, it turned out to be incredibly interesting and useful, not only for this class but also in CSE12. I got to learn working with GitBash and GitHub. Despite starting the course with no prior knowledge of either, I was amazed at how I could make changes on my computer and easily upload them online as backups or to share with my collaborators. Another fascinating skill I acquired was using Vim, which completely transformed how I work without relying on an environment like VScode. It was an eye-opening experience that showed me alternative ways to be productive.
