# **LAB REPORT 1**
Hello everyone, welcome to CSE 15L. This lab report mainly covers the procedure for installing VS Code, remotely connecting and trying some new commands.
## **Installing VS Code**
To install VS Code, I visited the Visual Studio Code website https://code.visualstudio.com/, and followed the instructions to download and install it on my computer.

I downloaded the Windows version for my laptop. When it was installed, it should open a window that looks like this:

## **Remotely Connecting**
First of all, I found my course specific account and reset the password. Then, I tried remotely connecting to the ieng6 server. I started by running a ssh command on the terminal. 
$ ssh cs15lsp23gb@ieng6.ucsd.edu
It led me to the following prompt where the system asked me to confirm my decision to connect to the server as I was connecting to it for the first time.
